# Intranet Landing Page

This repository contains a static intranet home page. Use the steps below to preview it locally.

## Quick preview
1. From this folder, start a simple web server (Python comes preinstalled on most systems):
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Open your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) — the page loads automatically from `index.html`.

If you prefer, you can also double-click `index.html` to open it directly in your browser without running a server.
